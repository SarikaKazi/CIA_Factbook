# CIA_Factbook

The World Factbook (published by the CIA) provides information on the history, people and society, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities.

In this project, I explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database.
